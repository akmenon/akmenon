<h2>Data for <i>A Machine Learning Framework for Programming by Example, ICML '13</i></h2>

<a href=pbe-all-benchmark-files.txt>Training examples</a>: The 279 
training examples we used to evaluate our system. Please note that some 
of these examples involve <i>multiple</i> inputs, an issue not discussed in 
the paper due to space constraints. In each example, "mock-in" and 
"mock-out" are what the learner has access to when performing test time 
inference. It runs its conjectured program on "in", and the result is 
compared to "out".

<br><br>

<a href=functionList.txt>Function list</a>: List of all function names 
used in the system; these are meant to be self-explanatory.

<br><br>

<a href=cueList.txt>Clue list</a>: List of all clues used in the 
system. It should be clear which functions these connect to.
