pbe-all-benchmark-files.txt: The 279 training examples we used to evaluate our system. Please note that some of these examples involve *multiple* inputs, an issue not discussed in the paper due to space constraints. In each example, "mock-in" and "mock-out" are what the learner has access to when performing test time inference. It runs its conjectured program on "in", and the result is compared to "out".

functionList: List of all function names used in the system; these are meant to be self-explanatory.

clueList.txt: List of all clues used in the system. It should be clear which functions these connect to.
