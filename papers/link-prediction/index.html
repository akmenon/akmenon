<h2>Code for <i>Link Prediction via Matrix Factorization, ECML '11</i></h2>

You can find MATLAB code for link prediction <a href=code-link-pred.zip>here</a>. The included functions are:
<ul>
	<li> <tt>link_prediction_test_script.m</tt>, a sample script that demonstrates usage on a synthetic network
	<li> <tt>factorisationSGDOptimiser.m</tt>, for optimisation of the classification loss
	<li> <tt>factorisationSGDRankingOptimiser.m</tt>, for optimisation of the ranking loss
</ul>

You can find MAT versions of the datasets used in the paper <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dw8j8ba56lditva/link-pred-datasets.zip?dl=0">here</a>.

<br>

<h3>Example usage</h3>

The script <tt>link_prediction_test_script.m</tt> illustrates the use of both the classification and ranking loss, and the presence and absence of side-information, on some synthetically generated data. You should observe output such as the following:
<br>
<br>

<div class="codebox">
	<code>
>> link_prediction_test_script;<br>
testing setting: standard loss, # node features = 0, # link features = 0<br>
rmse of predicted vs true probabilities = 0.2205<br>
optimal auc = 0.6959<br>
predicted auc = 0.6524<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
testing setting: ranking loss, # node features = 4, # link features = 1<br>
rmse of predicted vs true probabilities = 0.3257<br>
optimal auc = 0.7260<br>
predicted auc = 0.7126<br>
	</code>
</div>
<br>

<h3>Detailed description</h3>

Regarding use of either of the functions: you may just pass in <tt>[]</tt> for <tt>convergenceScoreTr</tt> and <tt>convergenceScoreTe</tt>. Just setting the # of epochs for SGD as appropriate would work. Similarly for <tt>computeObjective</tt>. This was used for early debugging, and is not essential.
<br>
<br>
Regarding the other arguments, <tt>weights</tt> is a structure that has the initial values for the parameters. Example initialization for the fields are as listed below.
<br>
<br>

<div class="codebox">
	<code>
weights = [];<br>
weights.U = randn(k, m); % for k latent features and m nodes<br>
weights.UBias = randn(1, m);<br>
weights.ULatentScaler = randn(k, k); % for asymmetric; for symmetric, use diag(randn(k)) instead<br>
weights.WPair = randn(1, dPair); % for dPair features for each pair<br>
weights.WBias = randn;<br>
weights.WBilinear = randn(1, dBilinear); % for dBilinear features for each node
	</code>
</div>
<br>
<br>
Similarly, <tt>lambda</tt> is a structure that has the regularization strengths for different parameters.
<br>
<br>
<div class="codebox">
	<code>
lambda = [];<br>
lambda.lambdaLatent = 0.1; % regularization for node's latent vector U<br>
lambda.lambdaRowBias = 0; % regularization for node's bias UBias<br>
lambda.lambdaLatentScaler = 0; % regularization for scaling factors Lambda (in paper)<br>
lambda.lambdaPair = 0; % regularization for weights on pair features<br>
lambda.lambdaBilinear = 0; % regularization for weights on node features<br>
lambda.lambdaScaler = 1; % scaling factor for regularization, can be set to 1 by default
</code>
